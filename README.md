# COMPENG2SH4-Practice-Qs-for-labs
This is a repository containing all of my answers for the practice exercises in the Principles of Programming course. The questions start off with C for 1,2, and 3 and move into Java for 4 and 5. The questions for C involve creating algorithms with functions, loops, etc. and analyzing data using arrays, pointers, arrays of pointers, and structures. The questions for Java involve creating classes and objects to do various things, and analyzing data through arrays, single-linked lists, and double-linked lists.
